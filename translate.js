      "In the past four years, Ben has accumulated rich programming experience. He also feels a strong burden for children with physical disabilities and understands that these children face significant challenges: limited physical accessibility often prevents them from fully enjoying games and lacking learning resources. This motivates him to become the founder and technical director of this project, using his strengths to design games and mathematics to create innovative, educational, and easy to understand games.":
